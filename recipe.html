    <h1>Anncipher's HTML Favourite Meal Recipe Book</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my Youtube Channel! That's not it <em>*chuckles*</em></p>
    <p>It's more like "Welcome to my first HTML <strong>Recipe Project</strong>!!!</p>
    <p>This is more than just some project to me, this is me taking y'all on a ride into a section of my life journal <bold>"My Favourite Meal"</bold>, while happily practicing my coding skills.</p> All you need to know is highlighted below:

    <em>*Disclaimer: There's so much more to my favourite meal than whatever I have here. Images are also not a true representation of what I'd prepare myself but you get the gist *winks*</em>
    
    <br><br><h3>About</h3>
    <p>My favourite meal/best food (bf like I do call it) is <strong>Jollof Rice</strong> with any available common protein. I mentioned common before the protein because I don't want someone feeding me unusual proteins in the name of food (so yea, our focus is sumptuous Jollof Rice). Smoky is extra spec.</p>
    Jollof Rice, also known as <strong>benachin and thieboudienne</strong>, is a one-pot meal that originated from the Wolof tribe in the 14th century. The Wolof Empire, ruling parts of modern-day Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, popularized jollof throughout West Africa. <em>I never really knew about at all that up until now, maybe because I never cared to find out; but now we know all thanks to Google Doodle</em>. One thing I'm aware of is the <em>Jollof Wars</em>, Nigerians and Ghanaians obsessing over who makes the best jollof. I really don't care about that too, just make my bf nice and yummy. Although I recently fell in love with the basmati Jollof and I read that's kinda a Ghanaian recipe (this is not me cheating on my Nigerian Jollof <em>*tongue out*</em>).
    <p>Let's prep the main dish.</p>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Boil water until hot, add rice and allow to parboil. Then drain</li>
        <li>Prepare pepper sauce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour vegetable oil into pot</li>
                <li>Add sliced onions and stir fry</li>
                <li>Put pepper blend (mix of scotch bonnets i.e atarodo, tomatoes, red bell peppers i.e tatashe) and tomato puree, then stir</li>
                <li>Add protein stock (chicken/beef) and allow to simmer for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Add curry, thyme, buillon cube and salt to taste</li>
                <li>Leave to simmer for another 10 minutes</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Pour parboiled rice into the sauce, and add little water</li>
        <li>Cover lid and allow to cook for 10-15 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve while hot with desired protein or veggies <em>*yummy right!*</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Extra Tips:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure to wash rice properly to remove excess starch that can cause it to become soggy. 3-4 rinses until water is clear is advised</li>
        <li>Stir mixture with wooden spoon to prevent burning</li>
        <li>Jollof rice requires steam to cook instead of boiling. Hence, use less water and low heat to prevent burning</li>
        <li>Add a little butter to achieve that shimmering look.</li>
    </ol>
